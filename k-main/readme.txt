This is an algorithm about k-mains.
In test.py is an easy way to separate 3D points
In advance.py i try to change the algorithm:
1) separate many categories ;
2) based on the points x, y, z coordinate, if in tow categories x,y or z have intersection;
3)Merge these two categories into one.   
in this way the k-mains algorithm can automately seperates the points in a fews categories.
